# UltraNoise

## What is Ultra Noise 

UltraNoise is a Node based processing tool for the Unity Editor.
Unlike external noise tools where the noise output is stored in a texture, UltraNoise contains all the logic built in the Scriptable Objects and allows you to sample any coordinate in any dimension.
UltraNoise also ships with tools that allow you to apply generated noises to various use cases.

## Under the Hood

WARNING!!
The tool uses Odin Inspector… A Lot. 
Until now our main goal was to provide a tool that works and is optimized and we did not want to waste time fighting with the Unity Editor.
Therefore, for the time being in order to use this tool you would have to get the Odin Inspector.
We have considered removing it but that's not in the plans yet.

UltraNoise’s power also surges from the following awesome free frameworks and Plugins:

* [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode)
* [Procedural Noise](https://github.com/Scrawk/Procedural-Noise/)

## How to learn Ultra Noise
The Best way to get started with UltraNoise is to download the Example project we have prepared from the following (https://github.com/KillMobil-SA/UltraNoiseExamples)

It contains several different examples scenes with graphs and nodes illustrating what can be achieved using the tool.
As an extra treat it contains a great selection of Shaders from the wizard himself, mister [Harry Alisavakis](https://twitter.com/harryalisavakis)
